==================================

This package defines some helper viewlets to easily insert code on the layout of a Plone site.

One use case is the insertion of ad code from sites like DoubleClick.

The name comes from the `blue-line process`_, a document reproduction produced by using the diazo chemical process.
You already know the rest of the story.
